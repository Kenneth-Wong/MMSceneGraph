## Dataset Information
This document is for recording the information of data under ./data/.


### coco
This is a MSCOCO (coco17) dataset mainly for object detection bechmark.

### caption\_coco
This is a MSCOCO dataset for image captioning. 

### coco\_vg\_mapping
It contains the class mapping from coco (consecutive: 1\~90; discrete: 1\~80) to visualgenome (150).

### glove
The GloVe vectors. 

### vg_evaluation
It is from [Scene-Graph-Benchmark.pytorch](https://github.com/KaihuaTang/Scene-Graph-Benchmark.pytorch) used for 
some scene graph evaluation protocols referred in [Unbiased Scene Graph Generation from Biased Training (CVPR 2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.11949)

### visualgenome
This is the mainly dataset for scene graph generation. See [factories/README.md](https://github.com/Kenneth-Wong/Scene-Graph-Benchmark-mmdet.pytorch/blob/master/factories/README.md) for details. 

### visualgenomekr
This is the dataset developed based on the visualgenome. For details, please refer our paper [Sketching Image Gist: Human-Mimetic Hierarchical Scene Graph Generation (ECCV 2020)](https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2020/papers_ECCV/papers/123580222.pdf)
See [factories/README.md](https://github.com/Kenneth-Wong/Scene-Graph-Benchmark-mmdet.pytorch/blob/master/factories/README.md) for details. 

### visualgenomegn
This is dataset developed based on the visualgenome. 


### vrd
This is a dataset for visual relationship detection and an auxiliary dataset for evaluating the SGG algorithms. 

### scene0000_00
